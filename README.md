# Simple Crud Application
---

## This application uses the following technology:
- **MongoDB** - Database to store the data using *mongoose*
- **Express** - Node.js framework
- **React** - Using *express-react-views* as a template rendering
- **Node.js** - Server side

### Things for improving
- Sluggify - so the link looks awesome
- More functionality other than CRUD
- Authentication
- Code cleanup for better readability such as the following:
  - Every folders should be seperated for routes, collections, models and views for better readability
  - Models should be named with models after the file e.g(Post.js should be named PostModels.js)
  - Collections should be named with collections after the file e.g(Post.js should be named PostCollections.js)
  - Routes should be named with collections after the file e.g(Post.js should be named PostRoutes.js)
- Modals for confirming the deletion of the user and other HTML DOM functionalities
